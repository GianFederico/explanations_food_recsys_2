This recipe may not be the best choice as it deviates significantly from the ideal macronutrient ratio. It is high in carbs. It is low in fats. It is low in proteins. Consider adjusting the portion size or exploring other recipes. The deviations from ideal values are: carbs = 7.57, fats= -11.98, proteins = -20.08 (anything in [-4,4] is good). Pumpkin cream has the following macronutrient distribution: 16.2g of carbs, 15.6g of fats, and 3.9g of proteins. This recipe may not be the best choice as it deviates significantly from the ideal macronutrient ratio. It is low in carbs. It is high in fats. It is low in proteins. Consider adjusting the portion size or exploring other recipes. The deviations from ideal values are: carbs = -7.0, fats= 5.6, proteins = -10.38 (anything in [-4,4] is good). In this case there is really no recipe better than the other, they both seem very unbalanced in the macro-nurients composition.\"}}"
